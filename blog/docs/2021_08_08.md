# Cherry Trees - CherryPy URL route handling

In our previous post, we introduced CherryPy as a performant, lightweight web server that developers can use to service web applications across http. We discussed how CherryPy uses hooks and mounts to construct an application tree, and how the structure of this tree allows CherryPy to handle URL routing automatically.

Today, we're going to go a bit more in depth with regard to this parsing tree, and show how we can create and expose application endpoints to the web server.

## Instance Mounting

When we start a CherryPy service, we need to mount our application to the framework.
