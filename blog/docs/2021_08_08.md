# Cherry Trees - CherryPy's URL route handling

In our previous post, we introduced CherryPy as a performant, lightweight web server that developers can use to service web applications across http. We discussed how CherryPy uses hooks and mounts to construct an application tree, and how the structure of this tree allows CherryPy to handle URL routing automatically.

Today, we're going to go a bit more in depth with regard to this parsing tree, and show how we can create and expose application endpoints to the web server.

## Instance Mounting

One of the main components in initializing a CherryPy web application is the mechanism for defining the URL routes associated with your various endpoints. In typical python web frameworks, routing is handled by having the user define relative endpoints in the function wrapper, and providing context for the expected request type. CherryPy however is designed so to have users mount apps onto the `cherrypy.tree` and have routing handled in accordance to where an instance is mounted relative to the application root.

```python
"""ex1.py"""
import cherrypy


class Root:
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self):
        return "This is the Root"

    @cherrypy.expose
    def fizz(self):
        return "Fizz"


class Buzz:
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self):
        return "Buzz"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = Root()
    root.buzz = Buzz()
    cherrypy.quickstart(root)
```

In the above example, we've created the Root endpoint by defining a special route method `def index(self)`, which corresponds to the URL root, which is in this case `/`. Next we've added the endpoints `/fizz` and `/buzz`. By default, CherryPy uses a route dispatcher, so named methods on the tree are treated as individual endpoints. A call to `/fizz` executes `root.fizz` and a call to `/buzz` executes `root.buzz.index`. 


CherryPy provides a second special route to developers for handling route dispatching, and that's the `def default(self)` method. If CherryPy is unable to find a matching URL route for a given request, it will 'default' to the deepest `def default(self)` on the URL path. The method is then passed the list of remaining unmatched strings.

```python
"""ex2.py"""
import cherrypy


class Root:
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self):
        return "This is the Root"

    @cherrypy.expose
    def default(self, *args):
        return f"Root args: [{', '.join(args)}]"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cherrypy.quickstart(Root())
```

```python
In [1]: import requests

In [2]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080').text
Out[2]: 'This is the Root'

In [3]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/fizz/buzz').text
Out[3]: 'Root args: [fizz, buzz]'
```

Methods can also take parameters explicitly. One way to accomplish this is by exposing method arguments as query parameters. Query parameters in URL's are delineated via a `?` character and then passed as `key=value` pairs. Joining pairs via the `&` character allows us to pass multiple parameters simultaneously. Finally, setting default values in the method prevents the route from failing if query parameters are absent from the request. It's also worth noting that values are passed as strings, so type conversions need to be implemented explicitly.

```python
"""ex3.py"""
import cherrypy


class Root:
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self, number, letter=''):
        result = f"number: {number}"
        if letter:
            result += f", letter: {letter}"
        return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cherrypy.quickstart(Root())
```

```python
In [4]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080?number=1&letter=a').text
Out[4]: 'number: 1, letter: a'

In [5]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080?number=1').text
Out[5]: 'number: 1'

In [6]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080').text
Out[6]: raise cherrypy.HTTPError(404, message="Missing parameters: number")
```

Methods can also take arguments implicitly, though this is a more difficult pattern to implement with CherryPy given its tree-based dispatch methodology. We can use the `cherrypy.popargs()` decorator to pop arguments from the URL path as cherrypy traverses the URL tree for an expected node. Arguments popped via `cherrypy.popargs()` are passed down as cherrypy traverses the tree and are available to consume at the final endpoint when reached.

```python
"""ex4.py"""
import cherrypy


class Root():
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self):
        return "this is root"


class Accounts(object):
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self):
        return "list accounts"


@cherrypy.popargs('account_id')
class Account:
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self, account_id=None):
        if account_id:
            return f"account {account_id}"
        return "no account requested"


class Items(object):
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self, account_id):
        return f"list account {account_id} items"


@cherrypy.popargs('account_item')
class Item:
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self, account_id, account_item=None):
        if account_item:
            return f"account {account_id} item {account_item}"
        return f"no items selected from account {account_id}"


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = Root()
    app.account = Account()
    app.accounts = Accounts()
    app.account.items = Items()
    app.account.item = Item()
    cherrypy.quickstart(app)
```

```python
In [7]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080').text
Out[7]: 'this is root'

In [8]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/accounts').text
Out[8]: 'list accounts'

In [9]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/account').text
Out[9]: 'no account requested'

In [10]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/account/5').text
Out[10]: 'account 5'

In [11]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/account/5/items').text
Out[11]: 'list account 5 items'

In [12]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/account/5/item').text
Out[12]: 'no items selected from account 5'

In [13]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/account/5/item/3').text
Out[13]: 'account 5 item 3'
```

These methods are all constructed to fit the design pattern expected by the default dispatch method, `cherrypy.dispatch.Dispatcher()`. CherryPy provides a second dispatch method, named `cherrypy.dispatch.MethodDispatcher()`, which is typically used when building a RESTful API on top of CherryPy (to note, we usually expect REST APIs to return json, but I want to save json implementation for when we discuss CherryPy's tooling. For now, please excuse the strings). Instead of mapping methods to endpoints, the `MethodDispatcher` maps class instances to endpoints, and on that class endpoint we can define methods like `def GET(self)`, `def POST(self)`, etc., so to map endpoint functionality in accordance to request type. If we wish to use this design pattern, we simply need to configure it by setting `request.dispatch` on a specific endpoint accordingly.

```python
"""ex5.py"""
import cherrypy


class Root:
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self):
        return "This is the Root"


@cherrypy.expose
class This:
    def GET(self):
        return "GET this"

    def POST(self):
        return "POST this"

    def DELETE(self):
        return "DELETE this"

    def PUT(self):
        return "PUT this"


def main():
    cherrypy.config.update({
        'server.socket_host': 'localhost'
    })

    root = Root()
    root.this = This()

    config = {
        "/this": {
            'request.dispatch': cherrypy.dispatch.MethodDispatcher()
        }
    }

    cherrypy.tree.mount(
        root=root, 
        script_name='/', 
        config=config
    )

    cherrypy.engine.start()
    cherrypy.engine.block()
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
In [14]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/this').text
Out[14]: 'GET this'

In [15]: requests.post('http://localhost:8080/this').text
Out[15]: 'POST this'

In [16]: requests.put('http://localhost:8080/this').text
Out[16]: 'PUT this'

In [17]: requests.delete('http://localhost:8080/this').text
Out[17]: 'DELETE this'
```

As mentioned, this `cherrypy.dispatch.MethodDispatcher()` object is most often found in RESTful api's. It's particularly useful when we want to incorporate the kind of URL argument parsing that we saw earlier. We can build both design patterns into a single application that provides most of the functionality that you would expect from a REST api.

```python
"""ex6.py"""
import time

import cherrypy


# close enough
DATABASE = {}


@cherrypy.expose
class Root():
    def GET(self):
        return "this is root"


@cherrypy.expose
class Accounts(object):
    def GET(self):
        return f"Accounts: [{', '.join(DATABASE.keys())}]"

    def POST(self, account_id):
        DATABASE[account_id] = {
            "metadata": {
                "time_created": time.time()
            },
            "items": {}
        }
        return f"initialize account {account_id} in accounts"


@cherrypy.expose
@cherrypy.popargs('account_id')
class Account:
    def GET(self, account_id=None):
        if account_id:
            return f'Account {account_id}: {DATABASE[account_id]["metadata"]}'
        return "no account requested"

    def DELETE(self, account_id=None):
        if account_id:
            del DATABASE[account_id]
            return f"Account {account_id} deleted"
        return "no account requested to delete"


@cherrypy.expose
class Items(object):
    def GET(self, account_id):
        return f'Account {account_id}: {DATABASE[account_id]["items"]}'

    def PUT(self, account_id, **kwargs):
        DATABASE[account_id]["items"].update(kwargs)
        return f"add {kwargs} to account {account_id}"


@cherrypy.expose
@cherrypy.popargs('account_item')
class Item:
    def GET(self, account_id, account_item=None):
        if account_item:
            return f"{DATABASE[account_id]['items'][account_item]}"
        return f"no items selected from account {account_id}"

    def DELETE(self, account_id, account_item=None):
        if account_item:
            del DATABASE[account_id]["items"][account_item]
            return f"delete item {account_item} from account {account_id}"
        return f"item deletion on account {account_id} was requested, but no item was specified"


def main():
    cherrypy.config.update({
        'server.socket_host': 'localhost'
    })

    root = Root()
    root.account = Account()
    root.accounts = Accounts()
    root.account.item = Item()
    root.account.items = Items()

    config = {
        "/": {
            'request.dispatch': cherrypy.dispatch.MethodDispatcher(),
        }
    }

    cherrypy.tree.mount(
        root=root, 
        script_name='/', 
        config=config
    )

    cherrypy.engine.start()
    cherrypy.engine.block()
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
In [18]: requests.post('http://localhost:8080/accounts/1').text
Out[18]: 'initialize account 1 in accounts'

In [19]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/account/1').text
Out[19]: "Account 1: {'time_created': 1628377315.8626635}"

In [20]: requests.put('http://localhost:8080/account/1/items/', data={'this': 'that'}).text
Out[20]: "add {'this': 'that'} to account 1"

In [21]: requests.get('http://localhost:8080/account/1/items/').text
Out[21]: "Account 1: {'this': 'that'}"

In [22]: requests.delete('http://localhost:8080/account/1/item/this').text
Out[22]: "delete item 'this' from account 1"
```

## Summary

Though CherryPy's route handling implementation scheme is unique, it nevertheless provides software developers with a robust design pattern that is capable of handling even the most complex APIs. It provides multiple configurable dispatch methods for URL routing, and it's pythonic approach to method dispatching allows developers to leverage their experience as python developers towards creating robust applications.
