# Cherry Trees - CherryPy URL route handling

In our previous post, we introduced CherryPy as a performant, lightweight web server that developers can use to service web applications across http. We discussed how CherryPy uses hooks and mounts to construct an application tree, and how the structure of this tree allows CherryPy to handle URL routing automatically.

Today, we're going to go a bit more in depth with regard to this parsing tree, and show how we can create and expose application endpoints to the web server.

## Instance Mounting

One of the main components in initializing a CherryPy web application is the mechanism for defining the URL routes associated with your various endpoints. In typical python web frameworks, routing is handled by having the user define relative endpoints in the function wrapper, and providing context for the expected request type. CherryPy however is designed so to have users mount apps onto the `cherrypy.tree` and have routing handled in accordance to where an instance is mounted relative to the application root.

```python
"""cherry.py"""
class Root:
    def index(self):
        return "This is the Root"

    def fizz(self):
        return "Fizz"

class Buzz:
    def index(self):
        return "Buzz"


def main():
    cherrypy.config.update({
        'server.socket_host': '0.0.0.0'
        })

    root = Root()
    root.buzz = Buzz()

    cherrypy.tree.mount(
        root=root, 
        script_name='/', 
        config=None
    )

    cherrypy.engine.start()
    cherrypy.engine.block()
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    
```

In the above example, we've created the Root endpoint by defining `def index(self)` which corresponds to the URL root `/`. Next we've added the endpoints `/fizz` and `/buzz`. By default 
CherryPy uses a route dispatcher, so named methods on the tree are treated as individual endpoints. A call to `/fizz` executes `root.fizz` and a call to `/buzz` executes `root.buzz.index`. 



These methods are all constructed to fit the design pattern expected by the default dispach method, `cherrypy.dispatch.RouteDispatcher()`. CherryPy provides a second dispatch method, aptly named `cherrypy.dispatch.MethodDispatcher()`. Instead of mapping methods to endpoints, the `MethodDispatcher` maps class instances to endpoints, and on that class endpoint we can define methods like `def GET(self)`, `def POST(self)` which maps endpoint functionality in accordance to the request type. If we wish to use this design pattern, we simply need to configure it by setting the `request.dispatch` on the specific endpoint accordingly.

```python
"""cherry.py"""
import cherrypy

class Root:
    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self):
        return "This is the Root"

@cherrypy.expose
class This:
    def GET(self):
        return "GET this"

    def POST(self):
        return "POST this"

    def DELETE(self):
        return "DELETE this"

    def PUT(self):
        return "PUT this"

def main():
    cherrypy.config.update({
        'server.socket_host': '0.0.0.0'
    })

    root = Root()
    root.this = This()

    config = {
        "/this": {
            'request.dispatch': cherrypy.dispatch.MethodDispatcher()
        }
    }

    cherrypy.tree.mount(
        root=root, 
        script_name='/', 
        config=config
    )

    cherrypy.engine.start()
    cherrypy.engine.block()
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
In [1]: import requests

In [2]: requests.get('http://0.0.0.0:8080/this').text
Out[2]: 'GET this'

In [3]: requests.post('http://0.0.0.0:8080/this').text
Out[3]: 'POST this'

In [4]: requests.put('http://0.0.0.0:8080/this').text
Out[4]: 'PUT this'

In [5]: requests.delete('http://0.0.0.0:8080/this').text
Out[5]: 'DELETE this'
```
